# Administrative-Geography-of-Bangladesh

All divisions, districts, subdistricts and unions are included in the csv and json format. I have also inclued Django Models 
for division, district, subdistrict and union. 
Initially the .csv file is loaded to database using proper formatting. Then, these data are dumped to json format using 
python manage.py dumpdata --format=json appname.Model > /path/to/store/filename.json commmand.

When any change is occured to fixture files, python manage.py loaddata /path/to/fixtures/filename.json command will update database with updated
data.
